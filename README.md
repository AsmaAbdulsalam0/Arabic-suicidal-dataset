# Arabic-suicidal-dataset
This dataset contains 5,719 Arabic tweets. Tweets were gathered using suicidal keywords in various Arabic dialects.

#Content
This dataset consists of Arabic tweets collected using Tweepy, a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. The tweets were gathered between August 23, 2021 and April 21, 2022 using Arabic suicidal keywords adapted from previous English-language studies.

After removing duplicates, a total of 5,719 tweets were retained. These tweets are written in various Arabic dialects (e.g., عايز اموت, ابى اموت, بدي موت) and were manually labeled by two annotators—one being a cyberpsychology expert. Each tweet was categorized as either:

1 – Suicidal

0 – Non-suicidal

This labeled dataset is intended to support research on suicidal ideation detection in Arabic social media content.
